# Lab 1
My first godot scene with a couple of pngs. Theres a farmer and 2 distinct apple trees. Then there is another scene with two of the same orange trees. The farmer is just picking apples so none of the orange trees are touched. Throughout creating this lab I learned how to use nodes and I learned how to operate github a lot better than I did before.
